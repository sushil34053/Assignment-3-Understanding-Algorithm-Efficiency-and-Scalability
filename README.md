Assignment 3: Understanding Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability

Overview

The purpose of the project is to explore the efficiency and scalability of randomized quicksort and hash tables with chaining. We have python implementation and comparison of the results we got from these models. 

Project Structure

Randomized_quicksort.py is the implementation of Randomized Quicksort and Deterministic Quicksort.

Hash_table_chaining.py is the implementation of a hash table with chaining for collision resolution.

How to Run

Run the Quicksort Analysis:

python randomized_quicksort.py

This script will be used to compare Randomized Quicksort and Deterministic Quicksort, plotting runtime performance for various input sizes.

Run the Hash Table Tests

python hash_table_chaining.py

This script will demonstrate the functionality of the hash table such as insert, search, and delete operations.
